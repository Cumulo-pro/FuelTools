## SYNC STATUS  
*cometbft_blocksync_syncing* 

**Fuel Block Synchronisation Metric:** A metric that indicates whether a node in the Fuel consensus system is syncing blocks. When this metric has a value of 1, it means that the node is actively syncing blocks. Conversely, a value of 0 indicates that the node is not currently syncing blocks. Block synchronization is the process by which a node updates its copy of the blockchain by downloading the most recent blocks from other nodes in the network.  

Value: 
- SYNC (syncing blocks)
- NO SYNC (not syncing blocks)
